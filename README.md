# 🌌 2D Solar System Simulation (Top View)

A simple **2D top-view simulation of the Solar System**, built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
This project is **not astronomically accurate**, but visually represents the **relative layout and motion** of planets orbiting the Sun in a flat, top-down view.

The main goal of this project is **learning and visualization**, not scientific precision.

---

## 📌 Features

- ☀️ Sun placed at the center
- 🪐 Planets orbiting in circular paths (top view)
- 🔄 Continuous orbital motion using JavaScript
- 🎨 Styled using pure CSS (no frameworks)
- ⚡ Lightweight and runs directly in the browser
- 🧠 Easy to understand structure for beginners

---

## 🚫 Limitations

- Distances between planets are **not to scale**
- Planet sizes are **not accurate**
- Orbits are simplified as perfect circles
- Physics like gravity, elliptical orbits, and axial tilt are **not implemented**

This is an **approximate visual model**, not a scientific simulator.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML** – structure of the solar system
- **CSS** – styling, colors, orbit paths
- **JavaScript** – animation and orbital movement
